<text id="H01-1001"> <title>Activity detection for information access to oral communication</title> <abstract> <entity id="H01-1001.1">Oral communication</entity> is ubiquitous and carries important information yet it is also time consuming to document. Given the development of <entity id="H01-1001.2">storage media and networks</entity> one could just record and store a <entity id="H01-1001.3">conversation</entity> for documentation. The question is, however, how an interesting information piece would be found in a <entity id="H01-1001.4">large database</entity> . Traditional <entity id="H01-1001.5">information retrieval techniques</entity> use a <entity id="H01-1001.6">histogram</entity> of <entity id="H01-1001.7">keywords</entity> as the <entity id="H01-1001.8">document representation</entity> but <entity id="H01-1001.9">oral communication</entity> may offer additional <entity id="H01-1001.10">indices</entity> such as the time and place of the rejoinder and the attendance. An alternative <entity id="H01-1001.11">index</entity> could be the activity such as discussing, planning, informing, story-telling, etc. This paper addresses the problem of the <entity id="H01-1001.12">automatic detection</entity> of those activities in meeting situation and everyday rejoinders. Several extensions of this basic idea are being discussed and/or evaluated: Similar to activities one can define subsets of larger <entity id="H01-1001.13">database</entity> and detect those automatically which is shown on a large <entity id="H01-1001.14">database</entity> of <entity id="H01-1001.15">TV shows</entity> . <entity id="H01-1001.16">Emotions</entity> and other <entity id="H01-1001.17">indices</entity> such as the <entity id="H01-1001.18">dominance distribution of speakers</entity> might be available on the <entity id="H01-1001.19">surface</entity> and could be used directly. Despite the small size of the <entity id="H01-1001.20">databases</entity> used some results about the effectiveness of these <entity id="H01-1001.21">indices</entity> can be obtained. </abstract>

<text id="H01-1041"> <title>Interlingua-Based Broad-Coverage Korean-to-English Translation in CCLING</title> <abstract> At MIT Lincoln Laboratory, we have been developing a <entity id="H01-1041.1">Korean-to-English machine translation system</entity> <entity id="H01-1041.2">CCLINC (Common Coalition Language System at Lincoln Laboratory)</entity> . The <entity id="H01-1041.3">CCLINC Korean-to-English translation system</entity> consists of two <entity id="H01-1041.4">core modules</entity> , <entity id="H01-1041.5">language understanding and generation modules</entity> mediated by a <entity id="H01-1041.6">language neutral meaning representation</entity> called a <entity id="H01-1041.7">semantic frame</entity> . The key features of the system include: (i) Robust efficient <entity id="H01-1041.8">parsing</entity> of <entity id="H01-1041.9">Korean</entity> (a <entity id="H01-1041.10">verb final language</entity> with <entity id="H01-1041.11">overt case markers</entity> , relatively <entity id="H01-1041.12">free word order</entity> , and frequent omissions of <entity id="H01-1041.13">arguments</entity> ). (ii) High quality <entity id="H01-1041.14">translation</entity> via <entity id="H01-1041.15">word sense disambiguation</entity> and accurate <entity id="H01-1041.16">word order generation</entity> of the <entity id="H01-1041.17">target language</entity> .

<text id="H01-1042"> <title>Is That Your Final Answer?</title> <abstract> The purpose of this research is to test the efficacy of applying <entity id="H01-1042.1">automated evaluation techniques</entity> , originally devised for the evaluation of <entity id="H01-1042.2">human language learners</entity> , to the <entity id="H01-1042.3">output</entity> of <entity id="H01-1042.4">machine translation (MT) systems</entity> . We believe that these <entity id="H01-1042.5">evaluation techniques</entity> will provide information about both the <entity id="H01-1042.6">human language learning process</entity> , the <entity id="H01-1042.7">translation process</entity> and the <entity id="H01-1042.8">development</entity> of <entity id="H01-1042.9">machine translation systems</entity> . This, the first experiment in a series of experiments, looks at the <entity id="H01-1042.10">intelligibility</entity> of <entity id="H01-1042.11">MT output</entity> . A <entity id="H01-1042.12">language learning experiment</entity> showed that <entity id="H01-1042.13">assessors</entity> can differentiate <entity id="H01-1042.14">native from non-native language essays</entity> in less than 100 <entity id="H01-1042.15">words</entity> . Even more illuminating was the factors on which the <entity id="H01-1042.16">assessors</entity> made their decisions. We tested this to see if similar criteria could be elicited from duplicating the experiment using <entity id="H01-1042.17">machine translation output</entity> . Subjects were given a set of up to six extracts of <entity id="H01-1042.18">translated newswire text</entity> . Some of the extracts were <entity id="H01-1042.19">expert human translations</entity> , others were <entity id="H01-1042.20">machine translation outputs</entity> . The subjects were given three minutes per extract to determine whether they believed the sample output to be an <entity id="H01-1042.21">expert human translation</entity> or a <entity id="H01-1042.22">machine translation</entity> . Additionally, they were asked to mark the <entity id="H01-1042.23">word</entity> at which they made this decision. The results of this experiment, along with a preliminary analysis of the factors involved in the decision making process will be presented here. </abstract>

We integrate a <entity id="H01-1049.3">spoken language understanding system</entity> with <entity id="H01-1049.4">intelligent mobile agents</entity> that mediate between <entity id="H01-1049.5">users</entity> and <entity id="H01-1049.6">information sources</entity> . We have built and will demonstrate an application of this approach called <entity id="H01-1049.7">LCS-Marine</entity> . Using <entity id="H01-1049.8">LCS-Marine</entity> , tactical personnel can converse with their logistics system to place a supply or information request. The request is passed to a <entity id="H01-1049.9">mobile, intelligent agent</entity> for execution at the appropriate <entity id="H01-1049.10">database</entity> . <entity id="H01-1049.11">Requestors</entity> can also instruct the system to notify them when the status of a <entity id="H01-1049.12">request</entity> changes or when a <entity id="H01-1049.13">request</entity> is complete.

<text id="H01-1058"> <title>On Combining Language Models : Oracle Approach</title> <abstract> In this paper, we address the problem of combining several <entity id="H01-1058.1">language models (LMs)</entity> . We find that simple <entity id="H01-1058.2">interpolation methods</entity> , like <entity id="H01-1058.3">log-linear and linear interpolation</entity> , improve the <entity id="H01-1058.4">performance</entity> but fall short of the <entity id="H01-1058.5">performance</entity> of an <entity id="H01-1058.6">oracle</entity> . The <entity id="H01-1058.7">oracle</entity> knows the <entity id="H01-1058.8">reference word string</entity> and selects the <entity id="H01-1058.9">word string</entity> with the best <entity id="H01-1058.10">performance</entity> (typically, <entity id="H01-1058.11">word or semantic error rate</entity> ) from a list of <entity id="H01-1058.12">word strings</entity> , where each <entity id="H01-1058.13">word string</entity> has been obtained by using a different <entity id="H01-1058.14">LM</entity> . Actually, the <entity id="H01-1058.15">oracle</entity> acts like a <entity id="H01-1058.16">dynamic combiner</entity> with <entity id="H01-1058.17">hard decisions</entity> using the <entity id="H01-1058.18">reference</entity> . We provide experimental results that clearly show the need for a <entity id="H01-1058.19">dynamic language model combination</entity> to improve the <entity id="H01-1058.20">performance</entity> further . We suggest a method that mimics the behavior of the <entity id="H01-1058.21">oracle</entity> using a <entity id="H01-1058.22">neural network</entity> or a <entity id="H01-1058.23">decision tree</entity> . The method amounts to tagging <entity id="H01-1058.24">LMs</entity> with <entity id="H01-1058.25">confidence measures</entity> and picking the best <entity id="H01-1058.26">hypothesis</entity> corresponding to the <entity id="H01-1058.27">LM</entity> with the best <entity id="H01-1058.28">confidence</entity> . </abstract>

<text id="N01-1003"> <title>SPoT: A Trainable Sentence Planner</title> <abstract> <entity id="N01-1003.1">Sentence planning</entity> is a set of inter-related but distinct tasks, one of which is <entity id="N01-1003.2">sentence scoping</entity> , i.e. the choice of <entity id="N01-1003.3">syntactic structure</entity> for elementary <entity id="N01-1003.4">speech acts</entity> and the decision of how to combine them into one or more <entity id="N01-1003.5">sentences</entity> . In this paper, we present <entity id="N01-1003.6">SPoT</entity> , a <entity id="N01-1003.7">sentence planner</entity> , and a new methodology for automatically training <entity id="N01-1003.8">SPoT</entity> on the basis of <entity id="N01-1003.9">feedback</entity> provided by <entity id="N01-1003.10">human judges</entity> . We reconceptualize the task into two distinct phases. First, a very simple, <entity id="N01-1003.11">randomized sentence-plan-generator (SPG)</entity> generates a potentially large list of possible <entity id="N01-1003.12">sentence plans</entity> for a given <entity id="N01-1003.13">text-plan input</entity> . Second, the <entity id="N01-1003.14">sentence-plan-ranker (SPR)</entity> ranks the list of output <entity id="N01-1003.15">sentence plans</entity> , and then selects the top-ranked <entity id="N01-1003.16">plan</entity> . The <entity id="N01-1003.17">SPR</entity> uses <entity id="N01-1003.18">ranking rules</entity> automatically learned from <entity id="N01-1003.19">training data</entity> . We show that the trained <entity id="N01-1003.20">SPR</entity> learns to select a <entity id="N01-1003.21">sentence plan</entity> whose rating on average is only 5% worse than the <entity id="N01-1003.22">top human-ranked sentence plan</entity> . </abstract>

Over the last few years dramatic improvements have been made, and a number of comparative evaluations have shown, that <entity id="I05-2048.3">SMT</entity> gives competitive results to <entity id="I05-2048.4">rule-based translation systems</entity> , requiring significantly less development time. This is particularly important when building <entity id="I05-2048.5">translation systems</entity> for new <entity id="I05-2048.6">language pairs</entity> or new <entity id="I05-2048.7">domains</entity> . This workshop is intended to give an introduction to <entity id="I05-2048.8">statistical machine translation</entity> with a focus on practical considerations. Participants should be able, after attending this workshop, to set out building an <entity id="I05-2048.9">SMT system</entity> themselves and achieving good <entity id="I05-2048.10">baseline results</entity> in a short time. The tutorial will cover the basics of <entity id="I05-2048.11">SMT</entity> : Theory will be put into practice. <entity id="I05-2048.12">STTK</entity> , a <entity id="I05-2048.13">statistical machine translation tool kit</entity> , will be introduced and used to build a working <entity id="I05-2048.14">translation system</entity> . <entity id="I05-2048.15">STTK</entity> has been developed by the presenter and co-workers over a number of years and is currently used as the basis of <entity id="I05-2048.16">CMU&apos;s SMT system</entity> . It has also successfully been coupled with <entity id="I05-2048.17">rule-based and example based machine translation modules</entity> to build a <entity id="I05-2048.18">multi engine machine translation system</entity> .

This paper investigates the utility of applying standard <entity id="I05-5003.3">MT evaluation methods (BLEU, NIST, WER and PER)</entity> to building <entity id="I05-5003.4">classifiers</entity> to predict <entity id="I05-5003.5">semantic equivalence</entity> and <entity id="I05-5003.6">entailment</entity> .

<text id="I05-5008"> <title>Automatic generation of paraphrases to be used as translation references in objective evaluation measures of machine translation</title> <abstract> We propose a method that automatically generates <entity id="I05-5008.1">paraphrase</entity> sets from <entity id="I05-5008.2">seed sentences</entity> to be used as <entity id="I05-5008.3">reference sets</entity> in objective <entity id="I05-5008.4">machine translation evaluation measures</entity> like <entity id="I05-5008.5">BLEU</entity> and <entity id="I05-5008.6">NIST</entity> . We measured the quality of the <entity id="I05-5008.7">paraphrases</entity> produced in an experiment, i.e., (i) their <entity id="I05-5008.8">grammaticality</entity> : at least 99% correct <entity id="I05-5008.9">sentences</entity> ; (ii) their <entity id="I05-5008.10">equivalence in meaning</entity> : at least 96% correct <entity id="I05-5008.11">paraphrases</entity> either by <entity id="I05-5008.12">meaning equivalence</entity> or <entity id="I05-5008.13">entailment</entity> ; and, (iii) the amount of internal <entity id="I05-5008.14">lexical and syntactical variation</entity> in a set of <entity id="I05-5008.15">paraphrases</entity> : slightly superior to that of <entity id="I05-5008.16">hand-produced sets</entity> .

<text id="J05-1003"> <title>Discriminative Reranking for Natural Language Parsing</title> <abstract> This article considers approaches which rerank the output of an existing <entity id="J05-1003.1">probabilistic parser</entity> . The base <entity id="J05-1003.2">parser</entity> produces a set of <entity id="J05-1003.3">candidate parses</entity> for each input <entity id="J05-1003.4">sentence</entity> , with associated <entity id="J05-1003.5">probabilities</entity> that define an initial <entity id="J05-1003.6">ranking</entity> of these <entity id="J05-1003.7">parses</entity> . A second <entity id="J05-1003.8">model</entity> then attempts to improve upon this initial <entity id="J05-1003.9">ranking</entity> , using additional <entity id="J05-1003.10">features</entity> of the <entity id="J05-1003.11">tree</entity> as evidence. The strength of our approach is that it allows a <entity id="J05-1003.12">tree</entity> to be represented as an arbitrary set of <entity id="J05-1003.13">features</entity> , without concerns about how these <entity id="J05-1003.14">features</entity> interact or overlap and without the need to define a <entity id="J05-1003.15">derivation</entity> or a <entity id="J05-1003.16">generative model</entity> which takes these <entity id="J05-1003.17">features</entity> into account . We introduce a new method for the <entity id="J05-1003.18">reranking task</entity> , based on the <entity id="J05-1003.19">boosting approach</entity> to <entity id="J05-1003.20">ranking problems</entity> described in Freund et al. (1998). We apply the <entity id="J05-1003.21">boosting method</entity> to <entity id="J05-1003.22">parsing</entity> the <entity id="J05-1003.23">Wall Street Journal treebank</entity> . The method combined the <entity id="J05-1003.24">log-likelihood</entity> under a <entity id="J05-1003.25">baseline model</entity> (that of Collins [1999]) with evidence from an additional 500,000 <entity id="J05-1003.26">features</entity> over <entity id="J05-1003.27">parse trees</entity> that were not included in the original <entity id="J05-1003.28">model</entity> . The new <entity id="J05-1003.29">model</entity> achieved 89.75% <entity id="J05-1003.30">F-measure</entity> , a 13% relative decrease in <entity id="J05-1003.31">F-measure</entity> error over the <entity id="J05-1003.32">baseline model's score</entity> of 88.2%. The article also introduces a new algorithm for the <entity id="J05-1003.33">boosting approach</entity> which takes advantage of the <entity id="J05-1003.34">sparsity of the feature space</entity> in the <entity id="J05-1003.35">parsing data</entity> . Experiments show significant efficiency gains for the new algorithm over the obvious <entity id="J05-1003.36">implementation</entity> of the <entity id="J05-1003.37">boosting approach</entity> . We argue that the method is an appealing alternative - in terms of both simplicity and efficiency - to work on <entity id="J05-1003.38">feature selection methods</entity> within <entity id="J05-1003.39">log-linear (maximum-entropy) models</entity> . Although the experiments in this article are on <entity id="J05-1003.40">natural language parsing (NLP)</entity> , the approach should be applicable to many other <entity id="J05-1003.41">NLP problems</entity> which are naturally framed as <entity id="J05-1003.42">ranking tasks</entity> , for example, <entity id="J05-1003.43">speech recognition</entity> , <entity id="J05-1003.44">machine translation</entity> , or <entity id="J05-1003.45">natural language generation</entity> . </abstract>

We extend prior work in two ways. We first apply approaches that have been proposed for <entity id="E06-1035.3">predicting top-level topic shifts</entity> to the problem of <entity id="E06-1035.4">identifying subtopic boundaries</entity> .

Examination of the effect of <entity id="E06-1035.8">features</entity> shows that <entity id="E06-1035.9">predicting top-level and predicting subtopic boundaries</entity> are two distinct tasks: (1) for predicting <entity id="E06-1035.10">subtopic boundaries</entity> , the <entity id="E06-1035.11">lexical cohesion-based approach</entity> alone can achieve competitive results, (2) for <entity id="E06-1035.12">predicting top-level boundaries</entity> , the <entity id="E06-1035.13">machine learning approach</entity> that combines <entity id="E06-1035.14">lexical-cohesion and conversational features</entity> performs best, and (3) <entity id="E06-1035.15">conversational cues</entity> , such as <entity id="E06-1035.16">cue phrases</entity> and <entity id="E06-1035.17">overlapping speech</entity> , are better indicators for the top-level prediction task. We also find that the <entity id="E06-1035.18">transcription errors</entity> inevitable in <entity id="E06-1035.19">ASR output</entity> have a negative impact on models that combine <entity id="E06-1035.20">lexical-cohesion and conversational features</entity> , but do not change the general preference of approach for the two tasks. </abstract>

Their <entity id="P80-1026.2">human listeners</entity> are usually able to cope with these deviations with little difficulty. If a <entity id="P80-1026.3">computer system</entity> wishes to accept <entity id="P80-1026.4">natural language input</entity> from its <entity id="P80-1026.5">users</entity> on a routine basis, it must display a similar indifference.

An idea which underlies the theory described in this paper is that a <entity id="P84-1064.5">disposition</entity> may be viewed as a <entity id="P84-1064.6">proposition</entity> with implicit <entity id="P84-1064.7">fuzzy quantifiers</entity> which are approximations to all and always, e.g., almost all, almost always, most, frequently, etc. For example, birds can fly may be interpreted as the result of suppressing the <entity id="P84-1064.8">fuzzy quantifier</entity> most in the <entity id="P84-1064.9">proposition</entity> most birds can fly. Similarly, young men like young women may be read as most young men like mostly young women. The process of transforming a <entity id="P84-1064.10">disposition</entity> into a <entity id="P84-1064.11">proposition</entity> is referred to as <entity id="P84-1064.12">explicitation</entity> or <entity id="P84-1064.13">restoration</entity> . <entity id="P84-1064.14">Explicitation</entity> sets the stage for representing the <entity id="P84-1064.15">meaning</entity> of a <entity id="P84-1064.16">proposition</entity> through the use of <entity id="P84-1064.17">test-score semantics</entity> (Zadeh, 1978, 1982). In this approach to <entity id="P84-1064.18">semantics</entity> , the <entity id="P84-1064.19">meaning</entity> of a <entity id="P84-1064.20">proposition</entity> , p, is represented as a procedure which tests, scores and aggregates the elastic constraints which are induced by p. The paper closes with a description of an approach to <entity id="P84-1064.21">reasoning with dispositions</entity> which is based on the concept of a <entity id="P84-1064.22">fuzzy syllogism</entity> . <entity id="P84-1064.23">Syllogistic reasoning with dispositions</entity> has an important bearing on <entity id="P84-1064.24">commonsense reasoning</entity> as well as on the <entity id="P84-1064.25">management of uncertainty</entity> in <entity id="P84-1064.26">expert systems</entity> . As a simple application of the techniques described in this paper, we formulate a definition of <entity id="P84-1064.27">typicality</entity> -- a concept which plays an important role in <entity id="P84-1064.28">human cognition</entity> and is of relevance to <entity id="P84-1064.29">default reasoning</entity> . </abstract>

<text id="J86-3001"> <title>Attention, Intentions, And The Structure Of Discourse</title> <abstract>
 In this paper we explore a new <entity id="J86-3001.1">theory of discourse structure</entity> that stresses the role of <entity id="J86-3001.2">purpose</entity> and <entity id="J86-3001.3">processing</entity> in <entity id="J86-3001.4">discourse</entity> . In this theory, <entity id="J86-3001.5">discourse structure</entity> is composed of three separate but interrelated components: the structure of the sequence of <entity id="J86-3001.6">utterances</entity> (called the <entity id="J86-3001.7">linguistic structure</entity> ), a structure of <entity id="J86-3001.8">purposes</entity> (called the <entity id="J86-3001.9">intentional structure</entity> ), and the state of <entity id="J86-3001.10">focus of attention</entity> (called the <entity id="J86-3001.11">attentional state</entity> ). The <entity id="J86-3001.12">linguistic structure</entity> consists of segments of the <entity id="J86-3001.13">discourse</entity> into which the <entity id="J86-3001.14">utterances</entity> naturally aggregate. The <entity id="J86-3001.15">intentional structure</entity> captures the <entity id="J86-3001.16">discourse-relevant purposes</entity> , expressed in each of the <entity id="J86-3001.17">linguistic segments</entity> as well as relationships among them. The <entity id="J86-3001.18">attentional state</entity> is an abstraction of the <entity id="J86-3001.19">focus of attention</entity> of the <entity id="J86-3001.20">participants</entity> as the <entity id="J86-3001.21">discourse</entity> unfolds. The <entity id="J86-3001.22">attentional state</entity> , being dynamic, records the objects, properties, and relations that are salient at each point of the <entity id="J86-3001.23">discourse</entity> . The distinction among these components is essential to provide an adequate explanation of such <entity id="J86-3001.24">discourse phenomena</entity> as <entity id="J86-3001.25">cue phrases</entity> , <entity id="J86-3001.26">referring expressions</entity> , and <entity id="J86-3001.27">interruptions</entity> . The <entity id="J86-3001.28">theory of attention, intention, and aggregation of utterances</entity> is illustrated in the paper with a number of example <entity id="J86-3001.29">discourses</entity> . Various properties of <entity id="J86-3001.30">discourse</entity> are described, and explanations for the behaviour of <entity id="J86-3001.31">cue phrases</entity> , <entity id="J86-3001.32">referring expressions</entity> , and <entity id="J86-3001.33">interruptions</entity> are explored.

These mistakes can lead to various kinds of misunderstandings between <entity id="J86-4002.13">speaker</entity> and <entity id="J86-4002.14">listener</entity> , including <entity id="J86-4002.15">reference failures</entity> or failure to understand the <entity id="J86-4002.16">speaker&apos;s intention</entity> .

Although <entity id="P86-1038.4">computational algorithms for unification of feature structures</entity> have been worked out in experimental research, these algorithms become quite complicated, and a more precise description of <entity id="P86-1038.5">feature structures</entity> is desirable. We have developed a <entity id="P86-1038.6">model</entity> in which descriptions of <entity id="P86-1038.7">feature structures</entity> can be regarded as <entity id="P86-1038.8">logical formulas</entity> , and interpreted by sets of <entity id="P86-1038.9">directed graphs</entity> which satisfy them. These <entity id="P86-1038.10">graphs</entity> are, in fact, <entity id="P86-1038.11">transition graphs</entity> for a special type of <entity id="P86-1038.12">deterministic finite automaton</entity> . This <entity id="P86-1038.13">semantics</entity> for <entity id="P86-1038.14">feature structures</entity> extends the ideas of Pereira and Shieber [11], by providing an interpretation for values which are specified by <entity id="P86-1038.15">disjunctions</entity> and <entity id="P86-1038.16">path values</entity> embedded within <entity id="P86-1038.17">disjunctions</entity> . Our interpretation differs from that of Pereira and Shieber by using a <entity id="P86-1038.18">logical model</entity> in place of a <entity id="P86-1038.19">denotational semantics</entity> . This <entity id="P86-1038.20">logical model</entity> yields a calculus of <entity id="P86-1038.21">equivalences</entity> , which can be used to simplify <entity id="P86-1038.22">formulas</entity> . <entity id="P86-1038.23">Unification</entity> is attractive, because of its generality, but it is often computationally inefficient. Our <entity id="P86-1038.24">model</entity> allows a careful examination of the <entity id="P86-1038.25">computational complexity</entity> of <entity id="P86-1038.26">unification</entity> .

To deal with this <entity id="P86-1038.31">complexity</entity> , we describe how <entity id="P86-1038.32">disjunctive</entity> values can be specified in a way which delays <entity id="P86-1038.33">expansion</entity> to <entity id="P86-1038.34">disjunctive normal form</entity> . </abstract>

So, for any place where the easily identifiable <entity id="C88-2132.7">fragments</entity> occur in the <entity id="C88-2132.8">sentence</entity> , the process will extend to both the left and the right of the <entity id="C88-2132.9">islands</entity> , until possibly completely missing <entity id="C88-2132.10">fragments</entity> are reached.

The types of information that a <entity id="J88-3002.7">user model</entity> may be required to keep about a <entity id="J88-3002.8">user</entity> are then identified and discussed. <entity id="J88-3002.9">User models</entity> themselves can vary greatly depending on the requirements of the situation and the implementation, so several dimensions along which they can be classified are presented.

With only 12 <entity id="H90-1060.14">training speakers</entity> for <entity id="H90-1060.15">SI recognition</entity> , we achieved a 7.5% <entity id="H90-1060.16">word error rate</entity> on a standard <entity id="H90-1060.17">grammar</entity> and <entity id="H90-1060.18">test set</entity> from the <entity id="H90-1060.19">DARPA Resource Management corpus</entity> .

However, our experience with <entity id="A92-1026.2">TACITUS</entity> ; especially in the <entity id="A92-1026.3">MUC-3 evaluation</entity> , has shown that principled techniques for <entity id="A92-1026.4">syntactic and pragmatic analysis</entity> can be bolstered with methods for achieving robustness.

<text id="A92-1027"> <title>An Efficient Chart-based Algorithm for Partial-Parsing of Unrestricted Texts</title> <abstract>

The <entity id="A92-1027.6">parser</entity> gains algorithmic efficiency through a <entity id="A92-1027.7">reduction</entity> of its <entity id="A92-1027.8">search space</entity> . As each new <entity id="A92-1027.9">edge</entity> is added to the <entity id="A92-1027.10">chart</entity> , the algorithm checks only the topmost of the <entity id="A92-1027.11">edges</entity> adjacent to it, rather than all such <entity id="A92-1027.12">edges</entity> as in conventional treatments. The resulting <entity id="A92-1027.13">spanning edges</entity> are insured to be the correct ones by carefully controlling the order in which <entity id="A92-1027.14">edges</entity> are introduced so that every final <entity id="A92-1027.15">constituent</entity> covers the longest possible <entity id="A92-1027.16">span</entity> . This is facilitated through the use of <entity id="A92-1027.17">phrase boundary heuristics</entity> based on the placement of <entity id="A92-1027.18">function words</entity> , and by <entity id="A92-1027.19">heuristic rules</entity> that permit certain kinds of <entity id="A92-1027.20">phrases</entity> to be deduced despite the presence of <entity id="A92-1027.21">unknown words</entity> . A further <entity id="A92-1027.22">reduction in the search space</entity> is achieved by using <entity id="A92-1027.23">semantic</entity> rather than <entity id="A92-1027.24">syntactic categories</entity> on the <entity id="A92-1027.25">terminal and non-terminal edges</entity> , thereby reducing the amount of <entity id="A92-1027.26">ambiguity</entity> and thus the number of <entity id="A92-1027.27">edges</entity> , since only <entity id="A92-1027.28">edges</entity> with a valid <entity id="A92-1027.29">semantic</entity> interpretation are ever introduced. </abstract>

 In this paper, a discrimination and robustness oriented <entity id="C92-1055.1">adaptive learning procedure</entity> is proposed to deal with the task of <entity id="C92-1055.2">syntactic ambiguity resolution</entity> . Owing to the problem of <entity id="C92-1055.3">insufficient training data</entity> and <entity id="C92-1055.4">approximation error</entity> introduced by the <entity id="C92-1055.5">language model</entity> , traditional <entity id="C92-1055.6">statistical approaches</entity> , which resolve <entity id="C92-1055.7">ambiguities</entity> by indirectly and implicitly using <entity id="C92-1055.8">maximum likelihood method</entity> , fail to achieve high <entity id="C92-1055.9">performance</entity> in real applications. The proposed method remedies these problems by adjusting the parameters to maximize the <entity id="C92-1055.10">accuracy rate</entity> directly. To make the proposed algorithm robust, the possible variations between the <entity id="C92-1055.11">training corpus</entity> and the real tasks are also taken into consideration by enlarging the <entity id="C92-1055.12">separation margin</entity> between the correct candidate and its competing members. Significant improvement has been observed in the test. The <entity id="C92-1055.13">accuracy rate</entity> of <entity id="C92-1055.14">syntactic disambiguation</entity> is raised from 46.0% to 60.62% by using this novel approach. </abstract>

While work in <entity id="A92-1023.1">speech recognition (SR)</entity> has a history of evaluation methodologies that permit comparison among various systems, until recently no methodology existed for either developers of <entity id="A92-1023.2">natural language (NL) interfaces</entity> or researchers in <entity id="A92-1023.3">speech understanding (SU)</entity> to evaluate and compare the systems they developed. Recently considerable progress has been made by a number of groups involved in the <entity id="A92-1023.4">DARPA Spoken Language Systems (SLS) program</entity> to agree on a methodology for comparative evaluation of <entity id="A92-1023.5">SLS systems</entity>, and that methodology has been put into practice several times in comparative tests of several <entity id="A92-1023.6">SLS systems</entity>. These evaluations are probably the only <entity id="A92-1023.7">NL evaluations</entity> other than the series of <entity id="A92-1023.8">Message Understanding Conferences</entity> (Sundheim, 1989; Sundheim, 1991) to have been developed and used by a group of researchers at different sites, although several excellent workshops have been held to study some of these problems (Palmer et al., 1989; Neal et al., 1991). This paper describes a practical <entity id="A92-1023.9">"black-box" methodology</entity> for automatic evaluation of <entity id="A92-1023.10">question-answering NL systems</entity>. While each new application domain will require some development of special resources, the heart of the methodology is domain-independent, and it can be used with either <entity id="A92-1023.11">speech or text input</entity>. The particular characteristics of the approach are described in the following section: subsequent sections present its implementation in the <entity id="A92-1023.12">DARPA SLS community</entity>, and some problems and directions for future development.

To further improve performance, various <entity id="C04-1058.6">error correction mechanisms</entity> have been developed, but in practice, most of them cannot be relied on to predictably improve performance on <entity id="C04-1058.7">unseen data</entity>; indeed, depending upon the <entity id="C04-1058.8">test set</entity>, they are as likely to degrade accuracy as to improve it.

The development and evolution of such a <entity id="C90-1002.7">hybrid architecture</entity> has lead to a <entity id="C90-1002.8">parser</entity> which is superior to any <entity id="C90-1002.9">known deterministic parser</entity>.

 Multimodal interfaces require effective <entity id="C00-1054.1">parsing</entity> and understanding of <entity id="C00-1054.2">utterances</entity> whose content is distributed across multiple input modes. Johnston 1998 presents an approach in which strategies for <entity id="C00-1054.3">multimodal integration</entity> are stated declaratively using a <entity id="C00-1054.4">unification-based grammar</entity> that is used by a <entity id="C00-1054.5">multidimensional chart parser</entity> to compose inputs. This approach is highly expressive and supports a broad class of <entity id="C00-1054.6">interfaces</entity>, but offers only limited potential for mutual compensation among the input modes, is subject to significant concerns in terms of computational complexity, and complicates selection among alternative multimodal interpretations of the input. In this paper, we present an alternative approach in which <entity id="C00-1054.7">multimodal parsing and understanding</entity> are achieved using a <entity id="C00-1054.8">weighted finite-state device</entity> which takes <entity id="C00-1054.9">speech and gesture streams</entity> as inputs and outputs their joint interpretation.

<title> Generation Of Relative Referring Expressions Based On Perceptual Grouping</title><abstract>
Past work of generating <entity id="C04-1096.1">referring expressions</entity> mainly utilized attributes of <entity id="C04-1096.2">objects</entity> and <entity id="C04-1096.3">binary relations</entity> between <entity id="C04-1096.4">objects</entity>. However, such an approach does not work well when there is no distinctive attribute among <entity id="C04-1096.5">objects</entity>. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a method utilizing the perceptual groups of <entity id="C04-1096.6">objects</entity> and <entity id="C04-1096.7">n-ary relations</entity> among them. The key is to identify groups of <entity id="C04-1096.8">objects</entity> that are naturally recognized by humans. We conducted psychological experiments with 42 subjects to collect <entity id="C04-1096.9">referring expressions</entity> in such situations, and built a <entity id="C04-1096.10">generation algorithm</entity> based on the results.

Coping With Derivation In A Morphological Component </title><abstract>
In this paper a <entity id="E93-1043.1">morphological component</entity> with a limited capability to automatically interpret (and generate) <entity id="E93-1043.2">derived words</entity> is presented. The system combines an extended <entity id="E93-1043.3">two-level morphology</entity> [Trost, 1991a; Trost, 1991b] with a <entity id="E93-1043.4">feature-based word grammar</entity> building on a <entity id="E93-1043.5">hierarchical lexicon</entity>. <entity id="E93-1043.6">Polymorphemic stems</entity> not explicitly stored in the <entity id="E93-1043.7">lexicon</entity> are given a <entity id="E93-1043.8">compositional interpretation</entity>. That way the system allows to minimize redundancy in the <entity id="E93-1043.9">lexicon</entity> because <entity id="E93-1043.10">derived words</entity> that are transparent need not to be stored explicitly. Also, <entity id="E93-1043.11">words formed ad-hoc</entity> can be recognized correctly. The system is implemented in CommonLisp and has been tested on examples from <entity id="E93-1043.12">German derivation</entity>.

<title> Chinese Term Extraction Based on Delimiters </title>
<abstract>
Existing techniques extract <entity id="L08-1154.1">term candidates</entity> by looking for <entity id="L08-1154.2">internal and contextual information</entity> associated with <entity id="L08-1154.3">domain specific terms</entity>. The algorithms always face the dilemma that fewer <entity id="L08-1154.4">features</entity> are not enough to distinguish <entity id="L08-1154.5">terms</entity> from <entity id="L08-1154.6">non-terms</entity> whereas more <entity id="L08-1154.7">features</entity> lead to more conflicts among selected <entity id="L08-1154.8">features</entity>. This paper presents a novel approach for <entity id="L08-1154.9">term extraction</entity> based on <entity id="L08-1154.10">delimiters</entity> which are much more stable and domain independent. The proposed approach is not as sensitive to <entity id="L08-1154.11">term frequency</entity> as that of previous works. This approach has no strict limit or <entity id="L08-1154.12">hard rules</entity> and thus they can deal with all kinds of <entity id="L08-1154.13">terms</entity>. It also requires no prior <entity id="L08-1154.14">domain knowledge</entity> and no additional <entity id="L08-1154.15">training</entity> to adapt to new <entity id="L08-1154.16">domains</entity>. Consequently, the proposed approach can be applied to different <entity id="L08-1154.17">domains</entity> easily and it is especially useful for <entity id="L08-1154.18">resource-limited domains</entity>. Evaluations conducted on two different <entity id="L08-1154.19">domains</entity> for <entity id="L08-1154.20">Chinese term extraction</entity> show significant improvements over existing techniques which verifies its efficiency and domain independent nature. Experiments on <entity id="L08-1154.21">new term extraction</entity> indicate that the proposed approach can also serve as an effective tool for <entity id="L08-1154.22">domain lexicon expansion</entity>.

It has also been studied in the framework of <entity id="X96-1059.5">Japanese information extraction</entity> ([3]) in recent years. Our approach to the Multi-lingual Evaluation Task (MET) for <entity id="X96-1059.6">Japanese text</entity> is to consider the given task as a <entity id="X96-1059.7">morphological analysis problem</entity> in <entity id="X96-1059.8">Japanese</entity>. Our <entity id="X96-1059.9">morphological analyzer</entity> has done all the necessary work for the <entity id="X96-1059.10">recognition and classification of proper names, numerical and temporal expressions, i.e. Named Entity (NE) items</entity> in the <entity id="X96-1059.11">Japanese text</entity>. The <entity id="X96-1059.12">analyzer</entity> is called "Amorph". Amorph recognizes <entity id="X96-1059.13">NE items</entity> in two stages: <entity id="X96-1059.14">dictionary lookup</entity> and <entity id="X96-1059.15">rule application</entity>. First, it uses several kinds of <entity id="X96-1059.16">dictionaries</entity> to segment and tag <entity id="X96-1059.17">Japanese character strings</entity>. Second, based on the information resulting from the <entity id="X96-1059.18">dictionary lookup stage</entity>, a set of <entity id="X96-1059.19">rules</entity> is applied to the <entity id="X96-1059.20">segmented strings</entity> in order to identify <entity id="X96-1059.21">NE items</entity>.

Using Decision Trees to Construct a Practical Parser </title>
<abstract>
This paper describes novel and practical <entity id="P98-1083.1">Japanese parsers</entity> that uses <entity id="P98-1083.2">decision trees</entity>. First, we construct a single <entity id="P98-1083.3">decision tree</entity> to estimate <entity id="P98-1083.4">modification probabilities</entity>; how one <entity id="P98-1083.5">phrase</entity> tends to modify another. Next, we introduce a <entity id="P98-1083.6">boosting algorithm</entity> in which several <entity id="P98-1083.7">decision trees</entity> are constructed and then combined for <entity id="P98-1083.8">probability estimation</entity>. The two constructed <entity id="P98-1083.9">parsers</entity> are evaluated by using the <entity id="P98-1083.10">EDR Japanese annotated corpus</entity>. The single-tree method outperforms the <entity id="P98-1083.11">conventional Japanese stochastic methods</entity> by 4%. Moreover, the boosting version is shown to have significant advantages; 1) better <entity id="P98-1083.12">parsing accuracy</entity> than its single-tree counterpart for any amount of <entity id="P98-1083.13">training data</entity> and 2) no <entity id="P98-1083.14">over-fitting to data</entity> for various <entity id="P98-1083.15">iterations</entity>.

Paraphrasing Depending on Bilingual Context Toward Generalization of Translation Knowledge </title>

This study presents a <entity id="I08-1043.1">method to automatically acquire paraphrases</entity> using <entity id="I08-1043.2">bilingual corpora</entity>, which utilizes the <entity id="I08-1043.3">bilingual dependency relations</entity> obtained by projecting a <entity id="I08-1043.4">monolingual dependency parse</entity> onto the other language sentence based on <entity id="I08-1043.5">statistical alignment techniques</entity>. Since the <entity id="I08-1043.6">paraphrasing method</entity> is capable of clearly disambiguating the <entity id="I08-1043.7">sense</entity> of an original <entity id="I08-1043.8">phrase</entity> using the <entity id="I08-1043.9">bilingual context</entity> of <entity id="I08-1043.10">dependency relation</entity>, it would be possible to obtain interchangeable <entity id="I08-1043.11">paraphrases</entity> under a given <entity id="I08-1043.12">context</entity>. Also, we provide an advanced method to acquire <entity id="I08-1043.13">generalized translation knowledge</entity> using the extracted <entity id="I08-1043.14">paraphrases</entity>.

 Multi-Tagging For Lexicalized-Grammar Parsing </title>
<abstract>
With performance above 97% <entity id="P06-1088.1">accuracy</entity> for <entity id="P06-1088.2">newspaper text</entity>, <entity id="P06-1088.3">part of speech (pos) tagging</entity> might be considered a solved problem. Previous studies have shown that allowing the <entity id="P06-1088.4">parser</entity> to resolve <entity id="P06-1088.5">pos tag ambiguity</entity> does not improve performance. However, for <entity id="P06-1088.6">grammar formalisms</entity> which use more <entity id="P06-1088.7">fine-grained grammatical categories</entity>, for example <entity id="P06-1088.8">tag</entity> and <entity id="P06-1088.9">ccg</entity>, <entity id="P06-1088.10">tagging accuracy</entity> is much lower.

In <entity id="C94-1091.3">Thai language</entity>, it frequently happens that there is fluctuation in the choice of <entity id="C94-1091.4">classifier</entity> for a given <entity id="C94-1091.5">concrete noun</entity>, both from the point of view of the whole <entity id="C94-1091.6">speech community</entity> and <entity id="C94-1091.7">individual speakers</entity>.

An Approach To Sentence-Level Anaphora In Machine Translation </title>

Exploring Various Knowledge In Relation Extraction</title>
<abstract>
<entity id="P05-1053.1">Extracting semantic relationships between entities</entity> is challenging. This paper investigates the incorporation of diverse <entity id="P05-1053.2">lexical, syntactic and semantic knowledge</entity> in <entity id="P05-1053.3">feature-based relation extraction</entity> using <entity id="P05-1053.4">SVM</entity>. Our study illustrates that the base <entity id="P05-1053.5">phrase chunking</entity> information is very effective for <entity id="P05-1053.6">relation extraction</entity> and contributes to most of the <entity id="P05-1053.7">performance improvement</entity> from <entity id="P05-1053.8">syntactic</entity> aspect while additional information from <entity id="P05-1053.9">full parsing</entity> gives limited further enhancement. This suggests that most of useful information in <entity id="P05-1053.10">full parse trees</entity> for <entity id="P05-1053.11">relation extraction</entity> is shallow and can be captured by <entity id="P05-1053.12">chunking</entity>. We also demonstrate how <entity id="P05-1053.13">semantic information</entity> such as <entity id="P05-1053.14">WordNet</entity> and <entity id="P05-1053.15">Name List</entity>, can be used in <entity id="P05-1053.16">feature-based relation extraction</entity> to further improve the <entity id="P05-1053.17">performance</entity>. <entity id="P05-1053.18">Evaluation</entity> on the <entity id="P05-1053.19">ACE corpus</entity> shows that effective incorporation of diverse <entity id="P05-1053.20">features</entity> enables our <entity id="P05-1053.21">system</entity> outperform previously best-reported <entity id="P05-1053.22">systems</entity> on the <entity id="P05-1053.23">24 ACE relation subtypes</entity> and significantly outperforms <entity id="P05-1053.24">tree kernel-based systems</entity> by over 20 in <entity id="P05-1053.25">F-measure</entity> on the <entity id="P05-1053.26">5 ACE relation types</entity>.

<text id="E89-1016"><title>User Studies And The Design Of Natural Language Systems</title>
<abstract>
This paper presents a <entity id="E89-1016.1">critical discussion</entity> of the various <entity id="E89-1016.2">approaches</entity> that have been used in the <entity id="E89-1016.3">evaluation of Natural Language systems</entity>. We conclude that previous <entity id="E89-1016.4">approaches</entity> have neglected to evaluate <entity id="E89-1016.5">systems</entity> in the context of their use, e.g. solving a <entity id="E89-1016.6">task</entity> requiring <entity id="E89-1016.7">data retrieval</entity>. This raises questions about the validity of such <entity id="E89-1016.8">approaches</entity>. In the second half of the paper, we report a <entity id="E89-1016.9">laboratory study</entity> using the <entity id="E89-1016.10">Wizard of Oz technique</entity> to identify <entity id="E89-1016.11">NL requirements</entity> for carrying out this <entity id="E89-1016.12">task</entity>. We evaluate the demands that <entity id="E89-1016.13">task dialogues</entity> collected using this <entity id="E89-1016.14">technique</entity>, place upon a <entity id="E89-1016.15">prototype Natural Language system</entity>. We identify three important requirements which arose from the <entity id="E89-1016.16">task</entity> that we gave our subjects: operators specific to the task of <entity id="E89-1016.17">database access</entity>, complex <entity id="E89-1016.18">contextual reference</entity> and reference to the <entity id="E89-1016.19">structure</entity> of the <entity id="E89-1016.20">information source</entity>.

LFG Semantics Via Constraints
</title>
<abstract>
<entity id="E93-1013.1">Semantic theories</entity> of <entity id="E93-1013.2">natural language</entity> associate <entity id="E93-1013.3">meanings</entity> with <entity id="E93-1013.4">utterances</entity> by providing <entity id="E93-1013.5">meanings</entity> for <entity id="E93-1013.6">lexical items</entity> and <entity id="E93-1013.7">rules</entity> for determining the <entity id="E93-1013.8">meaning</entity> of larger <entity id="E93-1013.9">units</entity> given the <entity id="E93-1013.10">meanings</entity> of their parts. Traditionally, <entity id="E93-1013.11">meanings</entity> are combined via <entity id="E93-1013.12">function composition</entity>, which works well when <entity id="E93-1013.13">constituent structure trees</entity> are used to guide <entity id="E93-1013.14">semantic composition</entity>. More recently, the <entity id="E93-1013.15">functional structure</entity> of <entity id="E93-1013.16">LFG</entity> has been used to provide the <entity id="E93-1013.17">syntactic information</entity> necessary for constraining <entity id="E93-1013.18">derivations</entity> of <entity id="E93-1013.19">meaning</entity> in a <entity id="E93-1013.20">cross-linguistically uniform format</entity>. It has been difficult, however, to reconcile this <entity id="E93-1013.21">approach</entity> with the combination of <entity id="E93-1013.22">meanings</entity> by <entity id="E93-1013.23">function composition</entity>.
In contrast to <entity id="E93-1013.24">compositional approaches</entity>, we present a <entity id="E93-1013.25">deductive approach</entity> to assembling <entity id="E93-1013.26">meanings</entity>, based on <entity id="E93-1013.27">reasoning with constraints</entity>, which meshes well with the unordered nature of <entity id="E93-1013.28">information</entity> in the <entity id="E93-1013.29">functional structure</entity>. Our use of <entity id="E93-1013.30">linear logic</entity> as a 'glue' for assembling <entity id="E93-1013.31">meanings</entity> also allows for a coherent treatment of <entity id="E93-1013.32">modification</entity> as well as of the <entity id="E93-1013.33">LFG</entity> requirements of <entity id="E93-1013.34">completeness</entity> and <entity id="E93-1013.35">coherence</entity>.

The <entity id="H89-2019.11">Common Answer Specification</entity> determines the <entity id="H89-2019.12">syntax</entity> of <entity id="H89-2019.13">answer expressions</entity>, the minimal <entity id="H89-2019.14">content</entity> that must be included in them, the <entity id="H89-2019.15">data</entity> to be included in and excluded from <entity id="H89-2019.16">test corpora</entity>, and the <entity id="H89-2019.17">procedures</entity> used by the <entity id="H89-2019.18">Comparator</entity>.

</title>
<abstract>
This article is devoted to the problem of <entity id="I05-6010.1">quantifying noun groups</entity> in <entity id="I05-6010.2">German</entity>. After a thorough description of the phenomena, the results of <entity id="I05-6010.3">corpus-based investigations</entity> are described. Moreover, some examples are given that underline the necessity of integrating some kind of information other than <entity id="I05-6010.4">grammar sensu stricto</entity> into the <entity id="I05-6010.5">treebank</entity>. We argue that a more sophisticated and fine-grained <entity id="I05-6010.6">annotation</entity> in the <entity id="I05-6010.7">tree-bank</entity> would have very positve effects on <entity id="I05-6010.8">stochastic parsers</entity> trained on the <entity id="I05-6010.9">tree-bank</entity> and on <entity id="I05-6010.10">grammars</entity> induced from the <entity id="I05-6010.11">treebank</entity>, and it would make the <entity id="I05-6010.12">treebank</entity> more valuable as a <entity id="I05-6010.13">source of data</entity> for <entity id="I05-6010.14">theoretical linguistic investigations</entity>.

Our preliminary experiments on building a <entity id="I05-5004.8">paraphrase corpus</entity> have so far been producing promising results, which we have evaluated according to <entity id="I05-5004.9">cost-efficiency</entity>, <entity id="I05-5004.10">exhaustiveness</entity>, and <entity id="I05-5004.11">reliability</entity>.

<title>A Construction-Specific Approach to Focused Interaction in Flexible Parsing </title>
<abstract>
A <entity id="P81-1033.1">flexible parser</entity> can deal with input that deviates from its <entity id="P81-1033.2">grammar</entity>, in addition to input that conforms to it. Ideally, such a <entity id="P81-1033.3">parser</entity> will correct the deviant input: sometimes, it will be unable to correct it at all; at other times, <entity id="P81-1033.4">correction</entity> will be possible, but only to within a range of ambiguous possibilities. This paper is concerned with such ambiguous situations, and with making it as easy as possible for the <entity id="P81-1033.5">ambiguity</entity> to be resolved through consultation with the user of the <entity id="P81-1033.6">parser</entity> - we presume interactive use. We show the importance of asking the user for clarification in as focused a way as possible. <entity id="P81-1033.7">Focused interaction</entity> of this kind is facilitated by a <entity id="P81-1033.8">construction-specific approach</entity> to <entity id="P81-1033.9">flexible parsing</entity>, with <entity id="P81-1033.10">specialized parsing techniques</entity> for each type of <entity id="P81-1033.11">construction</entity>, and specialized <entity id="P81-1033.12">ambiguity representations</entity> for each type of <entity id="P81-1033.13">ambiguity</entity> that a particular <entity id="P81-1033.14">construction</entity> can give rise to. A <entity id="P81-1033.15">construction-specific approach</entity> also aids in <entity id="P81-1033.16">task-specific language development</entity> by allowing a <entity id="P81-1033.17">language definition</entity> that is natural in terms of the <entity id="P81-1033.18">task domain</entity> to be interpreted directly without compilation into a <entity id="P81-1033.19">uniform grammar formalism</entity>, thus greatly speeding the <entity id="P81-1033.20">testing</entity> of changes to the <entity id="P81-1033.21">language definition</entity>. </abstract>

Since <entity id="C94-1088.3">wordbreaks</entity> are not conventionally marked in <entity id="C94-1088.4">Chinese text corpora</entity>, a <entity id="C94-1088.5">character-based collocation system</entity> has the dual advantages of avoiding <entity id="C94-1088.6">pre-processing distortion</entity> and directly accessing <entity id="C94-1088.7">sub-lexical information</entity>. Furthermore, <entity id="C94-1088.8">word-based collocational properties</entity> can be obtained through an auxiliary module of <entity id="C94-1088.9">automatic segmentation</entity>.

Unsupervised Learning Of Field Segmentation Models For Information Extraction </title><abstract>
The applicability of many current <entity id="P05-1046.1">information extraction techniques</entity> is severely limited by the need for <entity id="P05-1046.2">supervised training data</entity>.

Examples illustrating the output generated are presented, and some qualitative performance results and problems that were encountered are discussed. The analysis process applies successively more specific <entity id="J87-3001.13">phrasal analysis rules</entity> as determined by a hierarchy of <entity id="J87-3001.14">patterns</entity> in which less specific <entity id="J87-3001.15">patterns</entity> dominate more specific ones.
