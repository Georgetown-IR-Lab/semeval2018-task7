<title>Language Modeling With Sentence-Level Mixtures</title>
<abstract>
This paper introduces a simple <entity id="H94-1014.1">mixture language model</entity> that attempts to capture <entity id="H94-1014.2">long distance constraints</entity> in a <entity id="H94-1014.3">sentence</entity> or <entity id="H94-1014.4">paragraph</entity>. The model is an <entity id="H94-1014.5">m-component mixture</entity> of <entity id="H94-1014.6">digram models</entity>. The models were constructed using a <entity id="H94-1014.7">SK vocabulary</entity> and trained using a 76 million word <entity id="H94-1014.8">Wall Street Journal text corpus</entity>. Using the <entity id="H94-1014.9">BU recognition system</entity>, experiments show a 7% improvement in <entity id="H94-1014.10">recognition accuracy</entity> with the <entity id="H94-1014.11">mixture digram models</entity> as compared to using a <entity id="H94-1014.12">Digram model</entity>.

<title>Identifying Unknown Proper Names In Newswire Text</title>
<abstract>
The identification of unknown <entity id="W93-0105.1">proper names</entity> in <entity id="W93-0105.2">text</entity> is a significant challenge for <entity id="W93-0105.3">NLP systems</entity> operating on <entity id="W93-0105.4">unrestricted text</entity>. A system which indexes <entity id="W93-0105.5">documents</entity> according to <entity id="W93-0105.6">name references</entity> can be useful for <entity id="W93-0105.7">information retrieval</entity> or as a <entity id="W93-0105.8">preprocessor</entity> for more <entity id="W93-0105.9">knowledge intensive tasks</entity> such as <entity id="W93-0105.10">database extraction</entity>. This paper describes a system which uses <entity id="W93-0105.11">text skimming techniques</entity> for deriving <entity id="W93-0105.12">proper names</entity> and their <entity id="W93-0105.13">semantic attributes</entity> automatically from <entity id="W93-0105.14">newswire text</entity>, without relying on any listing of <entity id="W93-0105.15">name elements</entity>. In order to identify new names, the system treats <entity id="W93-0105.16">proper names</entity> as (potentially) <entity id="W93-0105.17">context-dependent linguistic expressions</entity>. In addition to using <entity id="W93-0105.18">information</entity> in the <entity id="W93-0105.19">local context</entity>, the system exploits a <entity id="W93-0105.20">computational model of discourse</entity> which identifies individuals based on the way they are described in the text, instead of relying on their description in a pre-existing <entity id="W93-0105.21">knowledge base</entity>.

<title>Representation of Atypical Entities in Ontologies</title>
<abstract>
This paper is a contribution to <entity id="L08-1274.1">formal ontology study</entity>. Some <entity id="L08-1274.2">entities</entity> belong more or less to a <entity id="L08-1274.3">class</entity>. In particular, some individual <entity id="L08-1274.4">entities</entity> are attached to <entity id="L08-1274.5">classes</entity> whereas they do not check all the <entity id="L08-1274.6">properties</entity> of the <entity id="L08-1274.7">class</entity>. To specify whether an individual <entity id="L08-1274.8">entity</entity> belonging to a <entity id="L08-1274.9">class</entity> is typical or not, we borrow the <entity id="L08-1274.10">topological concepts</entity> of interior, border, closure, and exterior. We define a system of <entity id="L08-1274.11">relations</entity> by adapting these <entity id="L08-1274.12">topological operators</entity>. A scale of <entity id="L08-1274.13">typicality</entity>, based on <entity id="L08-1274.14">topology</entity>, is introduced. It enables to define levels of <entity id="L08-1274.15">typicality</entity> where individual <entity id="L08-1274.16">entities</entity> are more or less typical elements of a <entity id="L08-1274.17">concept</entity>.

<title>Description Of The LINK System Used For MUC-4</title>
<abstract>
The University of Michigan's <entity id="M92-1039.1">natural language processing system</entity>, called <entity id="M92-1039.2">LINK</entity>, is a <entity id="M92-1039.3">unification-based system</entity> which we have developed over the last four years. Prior to <entity id="M92-1039.4">MUC-4</entity>, <entity id="M92-1039.5">LINK</entity> had been used to extract <entity id="M92-1039.6">information</entity> from <entity id="M92-1039.7">free-form texts</entity> in two narrow <entity id="M92-1039.8">application domains</entity>. One <entity id="M92-1039.9">application corpus</entity> contained <entity id="M92-1039.10">terse descriptions</entity> of symptoms displayed by malfunctioning automobiles, and the repairs which fixed them. The other <entity id="M92-1039.11">corpus</entity> described sequences of <entity id="M92-1039.12">activities</entity> to be performed on an <entity id="M92-1039.13">assembly line</entity>. In empirical testing in these two <entity id="M92-1039.14">domains</entity>, <entity id="M92-1039.15">LINK</entity> correctly processed 70% of previously unseen <entity id="M92-1039.16">descriptions</entity>. A <entity id="M92-1039.17">template</entity> was counted as correct only if all of the <entity id="M92-1039.18">fillers</entity> in the <entity id="M92-1039.19">template</entity> were filled correctly. In addition, <entity id="M92-1039.20">LINK</entity> generated incomplete (but not incorrect) <entity id="M92-1039.21">templates</entity> for another 15% of the <entity id="M92-1039.22">descriptions</entity>. These previous <entity id="M92-1039.23">domains</entity> were much narrower than the <entity id="M92-1039.24">MUC-4 terrorism domain</entity>. As a comparison, the <entity id="M92-1039.25">lexicons</entity> for the previous <entity id="M92-1039.26">domains</entity> contained only 300-500 <entity id="M92-1039.27">words</entity>, compared with 6700 <entity id="M92-1039.28">words</entity> in our <entity id="M92-1039.29">MUC-4 test configuration</entity>. Previous <entity id="M92-1039.30">grammar size</entity> ranged from 75-100 <entity id="M92-1039.31">rules</entity>, compared with over 500 <entity id="M92-1039.32">rules</entity> in the <entity id="M92-1039.33">MUC-4 knowledge base</entity>. In addition, the previous <entity id="M92-1039.34">application domains</entity> consisted only of <entity id="M92-1039.35">single-sentence inputs</entity>. Thus, the integration of <entity id="M92-1039.36">information</entity> from multiple <entity id="M92-1039.37">sentences</entity> was not an issue in our previous work.

Accurate <entity id="W04-3215.1">dependency recovery</entity> has recently been reported for a number of <entity id="W04-3215.2">wide-coverage statistical parsers</entity> using <entity id="W04-3215.3">Combinatory Categorial Grammar (ccg)</entity>. However, overall figures give no indication of a <entity id="W04-3215.4">parser's performance</entity> on specific <entity id="W04-3215.5">constructions</entity>, nor how suitable a <entity id="W04-3215.6">parser</entity> is for specific <entity id="W04-3215.7">applications</entity>. In this paper we give a detailed evaluation of a <entity id="W04-3215.8">ccg parser</entity> on <entity id="W04-3215.9">object extraction dependencies</entity> found in <entity id="W04-3215.10">wsj text</entity>. We also show how the <entity id="W04-3215.11">parser</entity> can be used to parse <entity id="W04-3215.12">questions</entity> for <entity id="W04-3215.13">Question Answering</entity>. The <entity id="W04-3215.14">accuracy</entity> of the original <entity id="W04-3215.15">parser</entity> on <entity id="W04-3215.16">questions</entity> is very poor, and we propose a novel technique for porting the <entity id="W04-3215.17">parser</entity> to a new <entity id="W04-3215.18">domain</entity>, by creating new <entity id="W04-3215.19">labelled data</entity> at the <entity id="W04-3215.20">lexical category level</entity> only. Using a <entity id="W04-3215.21">supertagger</entity> to assign <entity id="W04-3215.22">categories</entity> to <entity id="W04-3215.23">words</entity>, trained on the new data, leads to a dramatic increase in <entity id="W04-3215.24">question parsing accuracy</entity>.

Many features were introduced into these tasks and promising results were achieved. In this paper, we mainly focus on the second task : <entity id="D08-1034.9">SRC</entity>.

Different from the previous <entity id="D08-1034.15">SRC systems</entity>, we divided <entity id="D08-1034.16">SRC</entity> into three sub tasks in sequence and <entity id="D08-1034.17">trained models</entity> for each sub task. Under the <entity id="D08-1034.18">hierarchical architecture</entity>, each <entity id="D08-1034.19">argument</entity> should first be determined whether it is a numbered <entity id="D08-1034.20">argument</entity> or an <entity id="D08-1034.21">ARGM</entity>, and then be classified into <entity id="D08-1034.22">fine-gained categories</entity>.

Current efforts in <entity id="H90-1103.11">military applications</entity> of <entity id="H90-1103.12">speech technology</entity> which are highlighted include : (1) <entity id="H90-1103.13">narrowband (2400 b/s) and very low-rate (50-1200 b/s) secure voice communication</entity> ; (2) <entity id="H90-1103.14">voice/data integration in computer networks</entity> ; (3) <entity id="H90-1103.15">speech recognition</entity> in <entity id="H90-1103.16">fighter aircraft</entity>, military helicopters, battle management, and air traffic control <entity id="H90-1103.17">training systems</entity> ; and (4) <entity id="H90-1103.18">noise and interference removal</entity> for <entity id="H90-1103.19">human listeners</entity>. Opportunities for advanced applications are identified by means of descriptions of several generic systems which would be possible with advances in <entity id="H90-1103.20">speech technology</entity> and in <entity id="H90-1103.21">system integration</entity>. These generic systems include : (1) <entity id="H90-1103.22">integrated multi-rate voice/data communications terminal</entity> ; (2) <entity id="H90-1103.23">interactive speech enhancement system</entity> ; (3) <entity id="H90-1103.24">voice-controlled pilot's associate system</entity> ; (4) advanced <entity id="H90-1103.25">air traffic control training systems</entity> ; (5) <entity id="H90-1103.26">battle management command and control support system</entity> with <entity id="H90-1103.27">spoken natural language interface</entity> ; and (6) <entity id="H90-1103.28">spoken language translation system</entity>. In identifying problem areas and research efforts to meet application requirements, it is observed that some of the most promising research involves the integration of <entity id="H90-1103.29">speech algorithm techniques</entity> including <entity id="H90-1103.30">speech coding</entity>, <entity id="H90-1103.31">speech recognition</entity>, and <entity id="H90-1103.32">speaker recognition</entity>.

Although in preliminary experiments the extended strategy did not yield improved performance over <entity id="W93-0307.20">lexical association</entity> alone, a <entity id="W93-0307.21">qualitative analysis</entity> of <entity id="W93-0307.22">results</entity> suggests that the problem lies not in the <entity id="W93-0307.23">noun class information</entity>, but rather in the <entity id="W93-0307.24">multiplicity of classes</entity> available for each <entity id="W93-0307.25">noun</entity> in the absence of <entity id="W93-0307.26">sense disambiguation</entity>.

<title>EFLUF - An Implementation Of A FLexible Unification Formalism </title>
<abstract>
In this paper we describe <entity id="W97-1510.1">EFLUF</entity> - an implementation of <entity id="W97-1510.2">FLUF</entity>. The idea with this environment is to achieve a base for experimenting with <entity id="W97-1510.3">unification grammars</entity>. In this environment we want to allow the user to affect as many features as possible of the <entity id="W97-1510.4">formalism</entity>, thus being able to test and compare various <entity id="W97-1510.5">constructions </entity> proposed for <entity id="W97-1510.6">unification-based formalisms</entity>. The paper exemplifies the main features of <entity id="W97-1510.7">EFLUF</entity> and shows how these can be used for defining a <entity id="W97-1510.8">grammar</entity>. The most interesting features of <entity id="W97-1510.9">EFLUF</entity> are the various possibilities to affect the behavior of the system. The user can define new <entity id="W97-1510.10">constructions</entity> and how they unify, define new <entity id="W97-1510.11">syntax</entity> for his <entity id="W97-1510.12">constructions</entity> and use <entity id="W97-1510.13">external unification modules</entity>. The paper also gives a discussion on how a system like <entity id="W97-1510.14">EFLUF</entity> would work for a larger application and suggests some additional features and restrictions that would be needed for this.

The output of a <entity id="L08-1530.1">speech recognition system</entity> is not always ideal for <entity id="L08-1530.2">subsequent downstream processing</entity>, in part because <entity id="L08-1530.3">speakers</entity> themselves often make mistakes.

We examine the <entity id="W07-0210.16">syntactic dependency networks</entity> of seven <entity id="W07-0210.17">languages</entity>. In all these cases, we consistently obtain three findings. Firstly, <entity id="W07-0210.18">clustering</entity>, i.e., the probability that two <entity id="W07-0210.19">vertices</entity> which are linked to a common <entity id="W07-0210.20">vertex</entity> are linked on their part, is much higher than expected by chance. Secondly, the <entity id="W07-0210.21">mean clustering</entity> of <entity id="W07-0210.22">vertices</entity> decreases with their <entity id="W07-0210.23">degree</entity> - this finding suggests the presence of a <entity id="W07-0210.24">hierarchical network organization</entity>. Thirdly, the <entity id="W07-0210.25">mean degree</entity> of the <entity id="W07-0210.26">nearest neighbors</entity> of a <entity id="W07-0210.27">vertex</entity> x tends to decrease as the <entity id="W07-0210.28">degree</entity> of x grows - this finding indicates <entity id="W07-0210.29">disassortative mixing</entity> in the sense that <entity id="W07-0210.30">links</entity> tend to connect <entity id="W07-0210.31">vertices</entity> of dissimilar <entity id="W07-0210.32">degrees</entity>. Our results indicate the existence of common patterns in the <entity id="W07-0210.33">large scale organization</entity> of <entity id="W07-0210.34">syntactic dependency networks</entity>.

This method focuses attention on the <entity id="A92-1028.5">semantic attributes</entity> of <entity id="A92-1028.6">verbs</entity> and examines the context from the relationship between the <entity id="A92-1028.7">semantic attributes</entity> of <entity id="A92-1028.8">verbs</entity> governing <entity id="A92-1028.9">zero pronouns</entity> and the <entity id="A92-1028.10">semantic attributes</entity> of <entity id="A92-1028.11">verbs</entity> governing their <entity id="A92-1028.12">referents</entity>. The <entity id="A92-1028.13">semantic attributes</entity> of <entity id="A92-1028.14">verbs</entity> are created using 2 different viewpoints: <entity id="A92-1028.15">dynamic characteristics</entity> of <entity id="A92-1028.16">verbs</entity> and the relationship of <entity id="A92-1028.17">verbs</entity> to <entity id="A92-1028.18">cases</entity>.

This study considers four factors that are important when implementing this method in a <entity id="A92-1028.26">Japanese to English machine translation system</entity>: the difference in conception between <entity id="A92-1028.27">Japanese</entity> and <entity id="A92-1028.28">English</entity> expressions, the difference in case <entity id="A92-1028.29">frame patterns</entity> between <entity id="A92-1028.30">Japanese</entity> and <entity id="A92-1028.31">English</entity>, restrictions by voice and restriction by <entity id="A92-1028.32">translation structure</entity>.

The number of participating systems has grown from 25 in <entity id="X96-1007.6">TREC-1</entity> to 36 in <entity id="X96-1007.7">TREC-4</entity>, including most of the major <entity id="X96-1007.8">text retrieval software</entity> companies and most of the universities doing research in <entity id="X96-1007.9">text retrieval</entity> (see table for some of the participants). The diversity of the participating groups has ensured that <entity id="X96-1007.10">TREC</entity> represents many different approaches to <entity id="X96-1007.11">text retrieval</entity>, while the emphasis on individual experiments evaluated in a common setting has proven to be a major strength of <entity id="X96-1007.12">TREC</entity>. The test design and test collection used for <entity id="X96-1007.13">document detection</entity> in <entity id="X96-1007.14">TIPSTER</entity> was also used in <entity id="X96-1007.15">TREC</entity>. The participants ran the various tasks, sent results into <entity id="X96-1007.16">NIST</entity> for evaluation, presented the results at the <entity id="X96-1007.17">TREC</entity> conferences, and submitted papers for a proceedings. The <entity id="X96-1007.18">test collection</entity> consists of over 1 million <entity id="X96-1007.19">documents</entity> from diverse <entity id="X96-1007.20">full-text sources</entity>, 250 <entity id="X96-1007.21">topics</entity>, and the set of relevant <entity id="X96-1007.22">documents</entity> or "right answers" to those <entity id="X96-1007.23">topics</entity>. A <entity id="X96-1007.24">Spanish collection</entity> has been built and used during <entity id="X96-1007.25">TREC-3</entity> and <entity id="X96-1007.26">TREC-4</entity>, with a total of 50 <entity id="X96-1007.27">topics</entity>. <entity id="X96-1007.28">TREC-1</entity> required significant system rebuilding by most groups due to the huge increase in the size of the <entity id="X96-1007.29">document collection</entity> (from a traditional <entity id="X96-1007.30">test collection</entity> of several megabytes in size to the 2 gigabyte <entity id="X96-1007.31">TIPSTER collection</entity>). The results from <entity id="X96-1007.32">TREC-2</entity> showed significant improvements over the <entity id="X96-1007.33">TREC-1 results</entity>, and should be viewed as the appropriate baseline representing state-of-the-art <entity id="X96-1007.34">retrieval techniques</entity> as scaled up to handling a 2 gigabyte collection. <entity id="X96-1007.35">TREC-3</entity> therefore provided the first opportunity for more complex experimentation. The major experiments in <entity id="X96-1007.36">TREC-3</entity> included the development of <entity id="X96-1007.37">automatic query expansion techniques</entity>, the use of <entity id="X96-1007.38">passages or sub-documents</entity> to increase the <entity id="X96-1007.39">precision</entity> of <entity id="X96-1007.40">retrieval results</entity>, and the use of the <entity id="X96-1007.41">training information</entity> to select only the best <entity id="X96-1007.42">terms</entity> for routing <entity id="X96-1007.43">queries</entity>. Some groups explored hybrid approaches (such as the use of the <entity id="X96-1007.44">Rocchio methodology</entity> in systems not using a <entity id="X96-1007.45">vector space model</entity>), and others tried approaches that were radically different from their original approaches. <entity id="X96-1007.46">TREC-4</entity> allowed a continuation of many of these complex experiments. The topics were made much shorter and this change triggered extensive investigations in <entity id="X96-1007.47">automatic query expansion</entity>. There were also five new tasks called tracks. These were added to help focus research on certain known problem areas, and included such issues as investigating <entity id="X96-1007.48">searching</entity> as an interactive task by examining the process as well as the outcome, investigating techniques for <entity id="X96-1007.49">merging results</entity> from the various <entity id="X96-1007.50">TREC subcollections</entity>, examining the effects of <entity id="X96-1007.51">corrupted data</entity>, and evaluating routing systems using a specific <entity id="X96-1007.52">effectiveness measure</entity>. Additionally more groups participated in a track for <entity id="X96-1007.53">Spanish retrieval</entity>. The <entity id="X96-1007.54">TREC</entity> conferences have proven to be very successful, allowing broad participation in the overall <entity id="X96-1007.55">DARPA TIPSTER</entity> effort, and causing widespread use of a very large <entity id="X96-1007.56">test collection</entity>. All conferences have had very open, honest discussions of technical issues, and there have been large amounts of "cross-fertilization" of ideas. This will be a continuing effort, with a <entity id="X96-1007.57">TREC-5</entity> conference scheduled in November of 1996.

It follows from this definition that there are three general issues in <entity id="C88-1049.5">parser design</entity>: the structure to be assigned, the <entity id="C88-1049.6">type of grammar</entity>, the <entity id="C88-1049.7">recognition algorithm</entity>. Common <entity id="C88-1049.8">parsers</entity> employ <entity id="C88-1049.9">phrase structure descriptions</entity>, <entity id="C88-1049.10">rule-based grammars</entity>, and <entity id="C88-1049.11">derivation</entity> or <entity id="C88-1049.12">transition oriented recognition</entity>. The following choices result in a new <entity id="C88-1049.13">parser</entity>: The structure to be assigned to the input is a <entity id="C88-1049.14">dependency tree</entity> with <entity id="C88-1049.15">lexical, morpho-syntactic</entity> and <entity id="C88-1049.16">functional-syntactic information</entity> associated with each node and coded by <entity id="C88-1049.17">complex categories</entity> which are subject to <entity id="C88-1049.18">unification</entity>. The <entity id="C88-1049.19">grammar</entity> is lexicalized, i.e. the <entity id="C88-1049.20">syntactical relationships</entity> are stated as part of the <entity id="C88-1049.21">lexical descriptions</entity> of the elements of the <entity id="C88-1049.22">language</entity>. The algorithm relies on the <entity id="C88-1049.23">slot and filler principle</entity> in order to draw up complex structures.

Our research and development goals are more rapid development of <entity id="M91-1021.8">new applications</entity>, the ability to train (and re-train) systems based on <entity id="M91-1021.9">user markings</entity> of <entity id="M91-1021.10">correct and incorrect output</entity>, more accurate selection among <entity id="M91-1021.11">interpretations</entity> when more than one is found, an more <entity id="M91-1021.12">robust partial interpretation</entity> when no <entity id="M91-1021.13">complete interpretation</entity> can be found.

The inclusion of such <entity id="W04-0707.4">detectors</entity> was motivated by the observation that more than 50% of <entity id="W04-0707.5">definite descriptions (dds)</entity> in an average <entity id="W04-0707.6">corpus</entity> are <entity id="W04-0707.7">discourse new</entity> (Poesio and Vieira, 1998), but whereas the inclusion of <entity id="W04-0707.8">detectors</entity> for <entity id="W04-0707.9">non-anaphoric pronouns</entity> in algorithms such as <entity id="W04-0707.10">Lap-pin and Leass' (1994)</entity> leads to clear improvements in precision, the improvements in <entity id="W04-0707.11">anaphoric dd resolution</entity> (as opposed to <entity id="W04-0707.12">classification</entity>) brought about by the <entity id="W04-0707.13">detectors</entity> were rather small. In fact, Ng and Cardie (2002a) challenged the motivation for the inclusion of such <entity id="W04-0707.14">detectors</entity>, reporting no improvements, or even worse performance. We re-examine the literature on the topic in detail, and propose a <entity id="W04-0707.15">revised algorithm</entity>, taking advantage of the improved <entity id="W04-0707.16">discourse-new detection techniques</entity> developed by Uryupina (2003).

<title>Comparing Information Extraction Pattern Models</title>
<abstract>
Several recently reported techniques for the <entity id="W06-0202.1">automatic acquisition</entity> of <entity id="W06-0202.2">Information Extraction (IE) systems</entity> have used <entity id="W06-0202.3">dependency trees</entity> as the basis of their <entity id="W06-0202.4">extraction pattern representation</entity>. These approaches have used a variety of <entity id="W06-0202.5">pattern models</entity> (<entity id="W06-0202.6">schemes</entity> for representing <entity id="W06-0202.7">IE patterns</entity> based on particular parts of the <entity id="W06-0202.8">dependency analysis</entity>). An appropriate model should be expressive enough to represent the <entity id="W06-0202.9">information</entity> which is to be extracted from <entity id="W06-0202.10">text</entity> without being overly complicated. Four previously reported <entity id="W06-0202.11">pattern models</entity> are evaluated using existing <entity id="W06-0202.12">IE evaluation corpora</entity> and three <entity id="W06-0202.13">dependency parsers</entity>. It was found that one model, <entity id="W06-0202.14">linked chains</entity>, could represent around 95% of the <entity id="W06-0202.15">information of interest</entity> without generating an unwieldy number of <entity id="W06-0202.16">possible patterns</entity>.

To solve this problem, we propose <entity id="I08-1058.8">TypeAny</entity>, a novel <entity id="I08-1058.9">front-end interface</entity> that detects the <entity id="I08-1058.10">language</entity> of the <entity id="I08-1058.11">user's key entry</entity> and automatically dispatches the <entity id="I08-1058.12">input</entity> to the appropriate <entity id="I08-1058.13">text entry system</entity>. Unlike previously reported methods, <entity id="I08-1058.14">TypeAny</entity> can handle more than two <entity id="I08-1058.15">languages</entity>, and can easily support any new <entity id="I08-1058.16">language</entity> even if the available <entity id="I08-1058.17">corpus</entity> is small.

Since the <entity id="L08-1302.12">graphical elements</entity> in a <entity id="L08-1302.13">Pathway</entity> are of a very different nature than their corresponding <entity id="L08-1302.14">descriptions</entity> in <entity id="L08-1302.15">English text</entity>, we developed a <entity id="L08-1302.16">prototype system called PathText</entity>. The goal of <entity id="L08-1302.17">PathText</entity> is to serve as a bridge between these two different <entity id="L08-1302.18">representations</entity>. In this paper, we first describe the overall architecture and the <entity id="L08-1302.19">interfaces</entity> of the <entity id="L08-1302.20">PathText system</entity>, and then provide some details about the core <entity id="L08-1302.21">Text Mining components</entity>.
